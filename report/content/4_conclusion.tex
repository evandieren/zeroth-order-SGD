\section{Conclusion}

We have explored the theoretical convergence properties of four incremental algorithms: GD, SGD, SVRG, and SAGA. In particular, we examined how each algorithm overcomes various issues in the others. Using simulations, we investigated these properties, as well as the impact of step-size. These simulations confirmed the major theoretical results, but further work exploring the more subtle details could highlight interesting nuances of each algorithms. For example, exploring adapative step-sizes and comparing them to their constant counterparts is a potential future avenue of investigation.

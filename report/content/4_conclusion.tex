\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In this project, we assessed and compared various zeroth-order methods for SGD. While those methods are valid optimization methods, they are extremely slow, and do not cope with dimensionality increases. Their usage should therefore be kept only for problems where the already existing first-order methods do not work, as a last resort. From our literature review, we noted that no empirical comparison of computation time with respect to the dimensionality was done. Hence, Figure \ref{fig:plot_2} and its analysis is our main contribution to the subject.

Next steps of this work would be to assess the impact of the number of samples on computation time and loss for the ZO-SGD methods, and try to use those methods for other types of ML algorithms.
